<h2> About  Us</h2>

We are based in Ireland , selling a variety of seeds online – while further afield, England has been recommended to Irish readers for the hard-to-get or unusual varieties.  Organic Seed Valley aims to take this further by specialising in organic seeds for a niche selection of culinary herbs, as well as vegetables, fruits and edible flowers, which will be available for online distribution within the EU. 

In cities such as Dublin, where gardenless apartments are becoming the norm, seed-sewers have been largely dependent on remote suburban-based garden centres to source their seeds. If you live green and don’t have a car, this can be very frustrating and time-consuming. For this reason, the online market is ripe and ready for city-dwellers/aspiring seed-sewers to try our organic seeds.  

The seeds will each require their own details section where they are clearly defined with useful information for the customer. Depending on the time of season, the use of promotions and special offers will be available and form part of the site’s functionality. The site will also offer a unique tool to help beginner growers by generating seed recommendations based on their needs and environment.
